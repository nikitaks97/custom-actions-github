name: get and cache dependencies
description: |
  This action gets and caches dependencies for a project.
  It uses the `actions/cache` action to cache the dependencies.
  The cache key is based on the hash of the `package.json` file.
  The cache is restored if it exists, otherwise it is created.

  using: 'composite'
